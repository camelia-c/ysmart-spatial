This project, developed in GSoC 2012, aims to build a translator of spatial queries into MapReduce applications, extending the YSmart project. The translator extends YSmart by adding spatial features both in the grammar YSmart.g and in the XML2MapReduce Python code. Besides the inclusion of spatial features in the existent code to support spatial and integrated queries, the project aims at providing optimization of MapReduce generated jobs, through correlation analysis.
