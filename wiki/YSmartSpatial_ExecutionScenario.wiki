= Guide and Scenario for Executing YSmartSpatial =


After installing YSmartSpatial, following the steps in the readme (also available in the wiki at http://code.google.com/p/ysmart-spatial/wiki/SetupStartGuide), we are now ready for executing it.
By default, the environment is set up to use version 1 of RESQUE.

FOR EXECUTION WE NEED TO:

1) manually copy the file ./ysmartspatial/jts_library/jts-1.12.jar  to  $HADOOP_HOME/lib

2) See again what you configured during installation as SPATIAL_SETUP_FOLDER_LIB and CGAL_SETUP_FOLDER_LIB. 
Then manually edit the $HADOOP_HOME/conf/hadoop-env.sh file and add the following line in it:

export LD_LIBRARY_PATH= [PATH TO YOUR YSMARTSPATIAL]/ysmartspatial/bin:[SPATIAL_SETUP_FOLDER_LIB]:[CGAL_SETUP_FOLDER_LIB]




=== Generating the MapReduce jobs: ===

cd ./ysmartspatial

python translate_spatial.py ./test/cerere_simpla7_2.sql ./test/BIOMEDICAL.schema

The result is found in ./ysmartspatial/result and consists of:
  *  the YSmartCode folder , with the generated Java files
  *  the YSmartJar folder  , with the generated JAR files
  *  the  script with commands for execution.


=== Running the MapReduce jobs:  ===

From the automatically generated script file found in ./ysmartspatial/result , we need to issue the commands beinning with $HADOOP_HOME/bin/hadoop jar ........ that correspond to running mapreduce jobs on Hadoop.

When debugging in a single-node Hadoop environment, for the example of our query above, the following commands are used (remember that in advance we have copied ./ysmartspatial/jts_library/jts-1.12.jar  to  $HADOOP_HOME/lib  ):

cd ./ysmartspatial/result 

$HADOOP_HOME/bin/hadoop jar  ./YSmartJar/testquery1.jar edu/osu/cse/ysmart/testquery/testquery1 YSmartInput//MARKUP/ YSmartOutput//testquery1/ 

The result can be read in the output file or can be viewed in terminal after issuing the command:

cat YSmartOutput/testquery1/*

cd ..


=== Switching to version 2 of RESQUE , for benchmarking ==

Now let us switch to the version 2 of RESQUE, for benchmarking. We issue the commands :

python ./setup_integration_1.py uninstall

python ./setup_integration_2.py install


=== Generating the MapReduce jobs again, for the new configuration: ===

We generate again the MapReduce jobs, in this new configuration of the environment:

python translate_spatial.py ./test/cerere_simpla7_2.sql ./test/BIOMEDICAL.schema

=== Running the MapReduce jobs again, for the new configuration: ===

Running the MapReduce jobs:

cd ./ysmartspatial/result 

$HADOOP_HOME/bin/hadoop jar  ./YSmartJar/testquery1.jar edu/osu/cse/ysmart/testquery/testquery1 YSmartInput//MARKUP/ YSmartOutput//testquery1/ 

The result can be read in the output file or can be viewed in terminal after issuing the command:

cat YSmartOutput/testquery1/*
