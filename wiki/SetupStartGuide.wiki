== Install YSmartSpatial ==

  1. After you download the archive, extract it in a folder.

  2. Ensure the correct contents of the folders /jts_library and /boost_library as follows:
  
|*--boost_library/*

 |---- boost/                  (needs manual copying of folder boost/ from boost_1_48_0.tar.gz , after extracting the archive)

 |--------accumulators/

 |--------algorithm/

 |--------and so on.....

|*--jts_library/ *               (it is fully provided, it was copied the jars from lib/ from jts-1.12.zip , after extracting the archive)   
 |---- acme.jar

 |---- jdom.jar

 |---- jts-1.12.jar

 |---- JTS_Test.jar

 |---- jtsio-1.12.jar

 |---- junit.jar

 |---- xerces.jar

  3. Choose your appropriate Hadoop distribution and modify accordingly in the following two places:
  * file setup_integration.py , lines 40-42 / 44-46     (in method setup_integrate_install) :  for cloudera leave 44-46 uncommented and comment 40-42; for other distributions leave 40-42 uncommented and comment 44-46:
  * file code_genspatial.py,    lines 3775 / 3777 (in method compile_class):  for cloudera leave 3777 uncommented and comment 3775; for other distribution leave 3775 uncommented and comment 3777 .

  4. Execute:

cd ./ysmartspatial

python ./setup_spatial.py install


  5. Optional, re-generating the JNI integration library, in case you modify the body of the method in ReducerRESQUE.cpp

cd ./ysmartspatial

python ./setup_integration.py install
